#!/bin/sh

# A shell script for packing your submission.
#
# v.1.1.
#
# The script uses the JDK command-line utility jar to archive the contents of
# the subdirectories ./lib and ./src, which are hence assumed to exist.
#
# The script requires a little bit of adjustment before every submission.
#
# The ASSIGNMENT variable must be set to the number of the assignment hereby
# solved.
#
# The GROUP variable must describe the group that made the solution. In
# particular, it should be the initials of the participants, upper cased,
# separated by dots. Non-ASCII letters (e.g. Æ, Ø, and Å) should be replaced by
# their ASCII equivalents (i.e. AE, OE, AA). For instance, if your names are
# Peter Naur (PN) and Hans Christian Ørsted (HCOE), your should set the GROUP
# variable to HCOE.PN. Your names must be listed in alphabetic order, as in
# (H)ans comes before (P)eter.
